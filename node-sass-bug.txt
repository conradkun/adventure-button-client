Just to update from my end. I found that for some reason no matter what I did even after the permissions issue was resolved, it still wouldn't always run the install.js script. I also noticed it tends to happen when its only part of a large set of downloads.

As a safe guard, I just started running the install.js file after NPM Install command part of my build. This ensured that the vendor folder was always present.

Can't explain why the install file doesn't always get ran on each build. So my build script looks like this:

npm update
npm install
nodejs node_modules/node-sass/scripts/install.js
npm rebuild node-sass
